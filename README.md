This Add-on works by blocking the operation of JavaScript in your browser, and it also allows you to block elements on the page. The recommendation is not to enable JavaScript for all pages. This Add-on launches the tab with JavaScript enabled because some pages may not load correctly without it. The recommended approach is to disable JavaScript as soon as possible on the page by clicking the Add-on icon.

When you disable JavaScript, it will only affect the current tab, and this preference will be saved for future visits to the same site, ensuring that JavaScript remains blocked the next time you visit that site.
